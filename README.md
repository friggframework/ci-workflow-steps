# Left Hook - CI Workflow Steps

This repository provides access to reusable GitHub workflow steps that should abstract the heavy lifting for setting up custom check pipelines for our different projects.

## Goals
- Avoid code duplication for the workflows;
- Provide a good balance between parametrization and easy-to-use via reasonable defaults;
- Avoid application-specific definitions; they should only be placed here if defining something is easily shareable between most of our other repositories.
